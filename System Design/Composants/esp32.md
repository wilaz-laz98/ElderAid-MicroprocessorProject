How to Use the ESP32-WROOM-32 Module
1.	Setup Development Environment:
o	Use the Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework).
o	Install the ESP32 board package in the Arduino IDE.
2.	Connect the Hardware:
o	Connect the module to a USB-to-Serial adapter (e.g., CP2102 or CH340).
o	Wiring:
	VCC (3.3V) → 3.3V supply.
	GND → Ground.
	EN → Pull HIGH with a 10k resistor.
	GPIO0 → Ground (to enable flashing mode).
	TX/RX → USB-to-Serial adapter for communication.
3.	Upload Code:
o	Write a simple blink program in Arduino IDE to test the module.
cpp
Copier le code
void setup() {	
    pinMode(2, OUTPUT); // GPIO2 (onboard LED)
}
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(2, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(2, LOW);  // Turn LED OFF
    delay(1000);
}
o	Press BOOT (GPIO0) and RESET (EN) buttons when flashing the code.
4.	Connect Peripherals:
o	Sensors: Connect to ADC, I2C, or SPI pins.
