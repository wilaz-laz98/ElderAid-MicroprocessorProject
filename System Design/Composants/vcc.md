# 1. Input Voltage Levels
Digital input pins operate based on voltage thresholds that correspond to Low (0) and High (1) states:

- **Low-Level Voltage (V_IL)**: The maximum voltage considered as a LOW signal. Typically around 0–30% of VCC.
- **High-Level Voltage (V_IH)**: The minimum voltage considered as a HIGH signal. Usually 70–100% of VCC.
For example, if VCC = 5V:
- Vil= 0-1.5v 
- Vih=3.5-5v
For VCC = 3.3V:
- Vil=0-1v
 -Vih=2.3-3.3v
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Best Voltage for Signal Capturing
- 5V: Suitable for devices requiring clear, robust HIGH/LOW signals with wider voltage thresholds.

- 3.3V: Common for modern, power-efficient microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32, ARM-based MCUs).
  - Lower power consumption.
  - Compatible with most peripherals.

- 2.4V (or lower): Limited to specific low-power devices. Not ideal for robust digital signal capturing as the noise margins become smaller.

**Best Choice:**

- Use 3.3V if you're interfacing with modern components or sensors.
- Use 5V if you're working with legacy components or systems needing higher voltage thresholds 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Practical Consideration**
- Match your input voltage levels to the system’s VCC. For example:

   - If the system operates at 5V, ensure the HIGH signal voltage is close to 5V.
   - If the system operates at 3.3V, ensure the HIGH signal voltage is close to 3.3V.
- Avoid exceeding the VCC range on input pins to prevent damage to the microcontroller or digital circuit.

**4. VCC (Voltage Common Collector or Power Supply Pin)**
- Definition: VCC is the pin where you supply power (positive voltage) to the component or module.
- Purpose: It provides the electrical energy required for the device to operate.
- Typical Values:
  - 5V (common for older microcontrollers like Arduino UNO or TTL logic circuits).
  - 3.3V (common for modern microcontrollers like ESP32, STM32, or sensors).
  - 1.8V or lower (low-power devices).
**Example:**
 - If you connect a sensor that operates at 3.3V, you connect the VCC pin to a 3.3V power source.
-----------------------------
**5. GND (Ground Pin)**
- Definition: GND is the reference point for all voltages in the circuit. It represents 0V or the "ground" potential.
 - Purpose:
   - Completes the electrical circuit.
   - Provides a common reference for all connected components.
- Connection:
   - Connect GND pins of all components/modules to a common ground to avoid errors or noise.
**Example:**
If you power a microcontroller, its GND pin must connect to the GND of the power source (e.g., battery or power supply).
---------------------------------
# 6. OUT (Output Pin)
- Definition: OUT is the pin where the component/module sends its output signal.
- Purpose: Allows the component to transmit data, a signal, or voltage to another part of the circuit.
- Types of Output:
  - Digital Output: Outputs either a HIGH (1) or LOW (0) signal.
  - Analog Output: Outputs a variable voltage based on a condition
**Example:**
If a motion sensor outputs a signal through its OUT pin, it might send:
   - LOW (0V) when no motion is detected.
   - HIGH (e.g., 3.3V or 5V) when motion is detected.

# Summary: Steps to Connect a Device to ESP32
- VCC → Connect to 3.3V on ESP32 (use a regulator or step down if needed).
- GND → Connect to ESP32’s GND pin.
- OUT → Connect to an available GPIO pin. Ensure the signal voltage is 3.3V.
