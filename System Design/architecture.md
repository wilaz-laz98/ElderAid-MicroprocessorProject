# ARCHITECTING AN IT SYSTEM

This document heightlights the essential steps to architect/design an IT systemthat is scalable, maintainable, and efficient. It is a guide for IT professionals and system architects who want to design a robust and scalable IT system.

## Step 1: Define the System Requirements

The first step in designing an IT system is to define the system requirements. This includes identifying the system's purpose, functionality, and performance requirements. The system requirements should be documented in a clear and concise manner, including the system's functional and non-functional requirements.
     1.**functional requirements**
     2.**non-functional requirements**
     3.**use cases**

## step 2: Feasibility Study

A feasibility study is a preliminary investigation into the practicality of a system. It involves assessing the system's technical, financial, and operational feasibility. The study should identify potential risks and challenges associated with the system and provide recommendations for mitigating them.
    1.**technical feasibility**
    2.**financial feasibility**
    3.**operational feasibility**
    4.**risks and challenges** \(optional\)
    5.**recommendations for mitigation** \(optional\)

## Step 3: System Architecture Design

The system architecture design involves defining the overall structure and organization of the system. This includes identifying the system's components, interfaces, and data flows. The system architecture should be designed to meet the system requirements.
    1.**high level design**
        -**hardware**
        -**software**
    2.**low level design**
        -**system components**
        -**system interfaces**
        -**data flows**

## Step 4: Thechnology Selection

The technology selection involves choosing the appropriate technologies and tools for the system. This includes selecting the programming languages, databases, operating systems, and other software components. The technology selection should be based on the system requirements and the system architecture design.
    1.**hardware**:
        -**servers**
        -**storage**
        -**networking**
    2.**software**:
        -**programming languages**
        -**databases**
        -**operating systems**
    3.**tools**
        -**development tools**
        -**frameworks**
        -**libraries**
   

## Step 5: System Implementation

The system implementation involves building the system using the selected technologies and tools. This includes writing the code, testing the system, and deploying the system to production.
    1.**version control**
    2.**code development**
    3.**unit testing**

## Step 6: System Testing and Quality Assurance

The system testing and quality assurance involve verifying that the system meets the system requirements and functions as expected.
    1.**system testing**
    2.**quality assurance**
    3.**user acceptance testing**

## Step 7: System Deployment and Maintenance

The system deployment and maintenance involve deploying the system to production and ensuring that it continues to function as expected
    1.**system deployment plan**
    2.**system installation**

## Step 8: Documentation And Training

The documentation and training involve creating documentation for the system and providing training to the users and support staff.
    1.**documentation**
    3.**user manuals**
    2.**knowledge base**

## Step 9: Review and Evaluation

The final step in the IT system design process is to review and evaluate the system to ensure that it
meets the system requirements and functions as expected. This involves conducting a study on the performance metrics as well as the continuous feedback loop
